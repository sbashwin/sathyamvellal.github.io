A long 2014 comes to an end! Quite a lot of movies this year - Interstellar, The Hobbit, Godzilla, The Lego Movie, Captain America, How to Train Your Dragon 2, Night at the Museum 3; I'll stop here.

Notable soundtrack mentions -

+ Interstellar (Hans Zimmer. 'Nuf said)
+ The Hobbit
    + Sound of the Horn of Erebor
    + Thorin Oakenshield's theme (played in trumpt)
    + The Last Goodbye - by Billy Boyd
    + Shire theme
+ Captain America (Theme of the Winter Soldier!)
+ Godzilla (Main theme)
+ The Amazing Spider Man 2 (Electro's theme)

2015 is **very** interesting! I mean, *VERY*. Sequels to some of the *best* series, more comedy and action! Here's my list -
